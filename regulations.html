<h2>11. Mandatory Arbitration. </h2>
<p>11.1. Please read this Section carefully. YOU AND ADMINISTRATOR, AND EACH OF OUR RESPECTIVE AGENTS, CORPORATE PARENTS, SUBSIDIARIES, AFFILIATES, PREDECESSORS IN INTEREST, SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS, AGREE TO ARBITRATION (EXCEPT FOR MATTERS THAT MAY BE TAKEN TO SMALL CLAIMS COURT), AS THE EXCLUSIVE FORM OF DISPUTE RESOLUTION EXCEPT AS PROVIDED FOR BELOW, FOR ALL DISPUTES AND CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS TERMS AND CONDITIONS OR THE SERVICE, UNLESS YOU ARE LOCATED IN A JURISDICTION THAT PROHIBITS THE EXCLUSIVE USE OF ARBITRATION FOR DISPUTE RESOLUTION. Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, allows for more limited discovery than in court, and is subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. Please visit www.adr.org for more information about arbitration.</p>
<p>11.2. Commencing Arbitration. A party intending to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by an international courier with a tracking mechanism, a written notice of intent to arbitrate (a “Notice”), or, in the absence of a mailing address provided by you to Administrator, via any other method available to Administrator, including via e-mail. The Notice to Administrator must be addressed to Jiji.co.ke (Walie Holdings) is a company registered in the British Virgin Islands (with registered office at Quijano Chambers, P.O. Box 3159, Road Town, Tortola, British Virgin Islands), Attn: Chief Executive Officer (the "Arbitration Notice Address"). The Notice must (i) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (ii) set forth the specific relief sought (the "Demand"). If you and Administrator do not reach an agreement to resolve the claim within 30 days after the Notice is received, then you or Administrator may commence an arbitration proceeding as set forth below or file a claim in small claims court. THE AMERICAN ARBITRATION ASSOCIATION ("AAA") WILL ADMINISTER THE ARBITRATION IN ACCORDANCE WITH ITS COMMERCIAL ARBITRATION RULES AND THE SUPPLEMENTARY PROCEDURES FOR CONSUMER RELATED DISPUTES (THE "Rules"), AS MODIFIED BY THIS TERMS AND CONDITIONS. The Rules and AAA forms are available online at http://www.adr.org. If you are required to pay a filing fee to commence an arbitration against Administrator, then Administrator will promptly reimburse you for your confirmed payment of the filing fee upon Administrator's receipt of a Notice at the Arbitration Notice Address that you have commenced arbitration along with a receipt evidencing payment of the filing fee, unless your Demand is equal to or greater than $1,000 or was filed in bad faith, in which case you are solely responsible for the payment of the filing fee.</p>
<p>11.3. Arbitration Proceeding. The arbitration will be in English. A single independent and impartial arbitrator with his or her primary place of business in Alexandria, Virginia will be appointed pursuant to the Rules, as modified herein. You and Administrator agree to comply with the following rules, which are intended to streamline the dispute resolution process and reduce the costs and burdens on the parties: (i) the arbitration will be conducted online and/or be solely based on written submissions, the specific manner to be chosen by the party initiating the arbitration; (ii) the arbitration will not require any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless otherwise mutually agreed in writing by the parties; and (iii) any judgment on the award the arbitrator renders may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.</p>
<p>11.4. No Class Actions. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER LAW, YOU AND ADMINISTRATOR AGREE THAT YOU AND ADMINISTRATOR MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. FURTHER, YOU AGREE THAT THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE PROCEEDINGS OF MORE THAN ONE PERSON'S CLAIMS, AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS PROCEEDING, AND THAT IF THIS SPECIFIC PROVISO IS FOUND TO BE UNENFORCEABLE, THEN THE ENTIRETY OF THIS MANDATORY ARBITRATION SECTION WILL BE NULL AND VOID.</p>
<p>11.5. Decision of the Arbitrator. Barring extraordinary circumstances, the arbitrator will issue his or her decision within 120 days from the date the arbitrator is appointed. The arbitrator may extend this time limit for an additional 30 days in the interests of justice. All arbitration proceedings will be closed to the public and confidential, and all records relating thereto will be permanently sealed, except as necessary to obtain court confirmation of the arbitration award. The award of the arbitrator will be in writing and will include a statement setting forth the reasons for the disposition of any claim. The arbitrator will apply the laws of the State of California in conducting the arbitration. You acknowledge that these terms and your use of the Service evidences a transaction involving interstate commerce. The United States Federal Arbitration Act will govern the interpretation, enforcement, and proceedings pursuant to this Section 11.</p>
<p>11.6. Equitable Relief. The foregoing provisions of this Section 11 do not apply to any claim in which either party seeks equitable relief to protect such party’s copyrights, trademarks, or patents. For the avoidance of doubt, however, you acknowledge that, in the event Administrator or a third party breaches this Terms and Conditions, the damage or harm, if any, caused to you will not entitle you to seek injunctive or other equitable relief against Administrator, and your only remedy will be for monetary damages, subject to the limitations of liability set forth in this Terms and Conditions.</p>
<p>11.7. Claims. You and Administrator agree that, notwithstanding any other rights a party may have under law or equity, any cause of action arising out of or related to this Terms and Conditions or the Service, excluding a claim for indemnification, must commence within one year after the cause of action accrues. Otherwise, such cause of action is permanently barred.</p>
<p>11.8. Improperly Filed Claims. All claims you bring against Administrator must be resolved in accordance with this Section. All claims filed or brought contrary to this Section will be considered improperly filed. Should you file a claim contrary to this Section, Administrator may recover attorneys' fees and reimbursement of its costs, provided that Administrator has notified you in writing of the improperly filed claim, and you have failed to promptly withdraw the claim.</p>
<p>11.9. Modifications. In the event that Administrator makes any future change to the "Mandatory Arbitration" paragraph set forth above (other than a change to Administrator's Arbitration Notice Address), you may reject any such change by sending us written notice within thirty (30) days of the change to Administrator's Arbitration Notice Address, in which case your account with Administrator and your license to use the Service will terminate immediately, and this Section, as in effect immediately prior to the amendments you reject, will survive the termination of this Terms and Conditions.</p>
<h2>12. Miscellanies</h2>
<p>12.1. Except as otherwise provided, if any provision of this Terms and Conditions is held to be invalid, void or for any reason unenforceable, such provision shall be struck out and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions. In our sole discretion, we may assign this Terms and Conditions, and in such event, we will post notice on jiji.co.ke.</p>
